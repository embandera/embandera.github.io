          About Me
        </h4>
        <p>
        My name is Mitzi and I'm a data nerd and computer science student. My passion for data was sparked in Mexico City, where I worked alongside activists protesting against gendered violence. I was inspired and forever changed by how these incredible activists were using data-driven insights to fight gendered violence. 
      <br><br>
      As I pursued my B.A. in Psychology, I started to dream of using statistics and data for social good but I wasn't quite sure how or where to get started. I continued onto a fulfilling career in higher education and international student advising. However, I still found myself drawn back to my passion for working closely with data and research.
      <br><br>
      After a seven year career in higher education, I decided to pursue my data dreams in earnest. I enrolled in a data science bootcamp and began taking evening courses towards an Associate's Degree in Computer Science while working full-time at UCLA. I've loved learning how to program and getting to study areas like data science, social computing and tech for social good. 
      <br><br>
      I feel really lucky to have found this path with the help of my community and am committed to helping other women pursue their career dreams in any way that I can.
